Task: {{ task }}

Recent steps (latest last):
{% for step in steps %}
{% for msg in step %}
{{ msg.role }}: {{ msg.content }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

Candidate action:
{{ candidate.content }}

Assign a scalar score in the range **[0.0, 1.0]** reflecting how appropriate the candidate action is as the next step:
- **1.0**: Ideal next action; clearly correct, safe, minimal, and directly advances the task.
- **0.7–0.9**: Strong action; likely helpful but slightly indirect or missing a minor prerequisite.
- **0.4–0.6**: Plausible but suboptimal; inefficient exploration or weak connection to the immediate blocker.
- **0.1–0.3**: Poor choice; redundancy, unnecessary risk, or misunderstanding of observations.
- **0.0**: Clearly harmful, irrelevant, or very unlikely to succeed.

Output format:
REASONING: <2–5 sentences>
FINAL: <scalar value between 0.0 and 1.0>
